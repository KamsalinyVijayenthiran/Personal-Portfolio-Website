# Personal-Portfolio-Website
A responsive personal portfolio showcasing my journey as a Full Stack Developer Intern. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it features dynamic animations, a modern UI/UX, and EmailJS for seamless contact handling. This project highlights my ability to build user-centric web experiences as a BICT student at the University of Vavuniya.
